                     Baby Scene Graph Library

The files in this directory make up the source code for the "baby
scene graph" library.  This is sort of like training wheels for
computer graphics.  It is a functional scene graph library, with a few
nice features, and consistent handling of the various matrices.  But
it is a baby package.  If you find a feature missing from it, perhaps
consider that you're ready to graduate to a real scene graph package.
Like OSG, for example.  The build is set up to create doxygen output,
so please find the rest of the documentation there.

To build the documentation, execute cmake and make like this:

    $ cmake .. -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION
