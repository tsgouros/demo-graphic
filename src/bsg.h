/// \mainpage Baby Scene Graph
///
/// A set of classes to manage a collection of shaders and objects to
/// make it easy to define an OpenGL 3D object drawn by them.  This is
/// very specifically meant to support OpenGL version 2.1 and GLSL
/// 1.2. I know there are newer and better things out there, but this
/// is designed to support the lowest common denominator among the set
/// of machines that our group works on: student-owned laptops, CCV
/// linux workstations, and the Brown University YURT virtual reality
/// environment, to name a few.
///
/// In structure, this is very much a "Baby" Scene Graph package,
/// with a scene consisting of a graph of objects.  This package is a
/// teaching tool, as much as it is a package with which to get useful
/// things done.  If you run out of capacity here, consider using Open
/// Scene Graph before extending this one.
///
/// The important member classes are these:
///
///   lightList -- A list of light positions and colors.
///
///   shaderMgr -- Holds the code for the pieces of a shader
///                collection.  Use this to add a vertex or fragment
///                shader.  Has switches to compile them, and returns
///                the program index when it's needed.  Controls the
///                text of the shader to adjust to match the number of
///                lights and so on.
///
///   bsgPtr -- A smart pointer.  We use it for shaderMgr, so that
///                multiple objects can use the same shader object.
///                We use it from drawableCompound so that you can
///                sub-class those and still have an object you can
///                include in a scene.
///
///   textureMgr -- A class to hold a texture and take care of loading
///                it into the OpenGL slots where it belongs.
///
///   drawableObj -- Contains a set of vertices, colors, normals,
///                texture coordinates, whatever.  Points to a
///                particular shaderMgr for drawing the object.
///
///   drawableCompound -- A collection of drawableObj objects to be
///                considered a single object.  This is where the
///                model matrix is applied, so it's ok if it's a
///                compound of just one drawableObj.  There is no
///                capacity for independent control of the member
///                objects of a drawableCompound.  If that's what you
///                want, use drawableCollection.
///
///   drawableCollection -- A collection of drawableCompound objects
///                that make up a scene.  Can also contain a bunch of
///                drawableCollection objects, making this into a
///                scene graph API.  You can access the member objects
///                independently, by name or hash.
///
///   \ref scene -- Contains a "root" drawableCollection, along with some
///                facilities for managing view and projection
///                matrices and for controlling the rendering of the
///                whole scene.  Use this as the basis of a scene, and
